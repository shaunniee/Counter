A simple counter using react
<li>In this project i have made use of react hook useState to change the state of the counter</li>
<li>When the + button is pressed the increament handler is fired and the counters value will be increamented</li>
<li>When the - button is pressed the decreament handler function is fired which first checks if the value of the counter is 0,and if its 0 it
returns else it decreaments </li>
</br>

This project demonstrates a simple use of the useState hook and how the state changes can be controlled using the hook!
